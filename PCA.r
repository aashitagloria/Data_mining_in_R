# There are two main functions for running PCA in R: 
# - the princomp function in the base package Stat
# - PCA in the FactoMineR package

#-------- PCA with the FactoMineR package

data(decathlon)
?decathlon 
# This dataset contains the performances of 41 athletes during two sporting events.
# The variables in this data set are:
# - decathlon[,1:10]: the performances of the athletes in the 10 disciplines 
# - decathlon[,11]: the ranking of the athletes (Rank)
# - decathlon[,12]: the overall score the athletes received at the end of the competition (Points); 
# - decathlon[,13]: the circuit of the race: whether it was olympic or world cup (Competition).
# Var 1:12 are quantitaive variables, var 13 is a nominal variable
 summary(decathlon)
#
#
# Before doing PCA, Let us check correlations.
round(cor(decathlon[,1:12]),digits=2) # digits define the number of decimals to report

# Let's plot des correlations
install.packages("corrplot")  # for visualizing correlation matrix
library(corrplot)             # for help on the corrplot package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html

corrplot.mixed(cor(decathlon[,1:12]), upper = "ellipse")  # corrplot.mixed() allow for defining different visual method for the lower and upper triangular separately.

# run a PCA on the first 10 quantitative variables
# var 11 and 12 are excluded because they depends on the first 10
# var 13 is excluded because is a nominal variable
res.pca = PCA(decathlon[,1:10], scale.unit=TRUE, ncp=10, graph=T)    #scale.unit: to choose whether to scale the data or not 
                                                                    #ncp: number of dimensions kept in the result

summary(res.pca)
#
# The first part of the results refer to eigenvalues, and hence to the explained inertia. 
# The reported quantities are: 
# - Variance: the eigenvalue associated to each axes (that, as we saw, coincides with the variance of the points along that axis); 
# - % of var.: percentage of explained inertia;
# - Cumulative % of var.: cumulative percentage of inertia explained by the first Q axes.
#
# The second chunk of output is for individuals (top 10 by default, to see all the units use the command specified below).
# For each axes (except for Dist that is a global value) summary print: 
# - Dist is the distance of each individial from the center of the map (that is the square root of the sum of the squared coordinates); 
# - Dim is the coordinate of the individual on each axis; 
# - ctr is the absolute contributions of the individual to each axis; 
# - cos2 is the relative contribution to each axis. 
#
# The third chunk is for variables. The following values are reported for each axes:
# - Dim is the coordinate of the variable on each axis; 
# - ctr is the absolute contributions of the variable to each axis; 
# - cos2 is the relative contribution to each axis. 
#
# more detailed results can be obtained by:
names(res.pca)
res.pca$eig # eigenvalue associated to each axe and corresponding explained variability
res.pca$ind  # outputs for the observation (coordinate, cos2, contribution to the axe)
round(res.pca$ind$cos2,2)    # cos2 = the quality of the individuals on the factor map
res.pca$ind$coord# coordinate of the individual on each axis
res.pca$var   # outputs for the variables (coordinate, cos2, contribution to the axe)

###### Supplementary variables
